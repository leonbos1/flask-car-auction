# flask-car-auction

The "flask-car-auction" is a web application built using the Flask framework. It allows users to browse and bid on cars that are automatically added to the website through the included webscraper. The webscraper is designed to scrape information from Autoscout24, a popular European car marketplace, to add real cars to the auction website. This project is a great example of how web scraping and web development can be combined to create a functional and useful application.

The codebase is well-organized and well-commented, making it easy to understand and modify as needed. Additionally, you will also need to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file in order to run the application.
